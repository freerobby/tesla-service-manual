Welcome to the unofficial Tesla service manual. This is a community source of information about how to maintain and repair your Tesla Roadster/S/X/3.

## Goals

* Accumulate community knowledge in one place, where everyone can find it.
* Make it as easy for owners to share maintenance and modification insights with other owners.
* Encourage DIY and third party servicing of Tesla vehicles, so that owners are less dependent on Tesla.
* Give owners confidence to work on their vehicles within their abilities.

## Anti-goals

This manual will not help you:

* Acquire proprietary Tesla information
* Subvert Tesla vehicle security, including achieving root access to a vehicle.
