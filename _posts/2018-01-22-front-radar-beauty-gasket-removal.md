title:  "Front Radar Beauty Gasket Removal"

## Description

Pre-Facelift Model S vehicles with Autopilot shipped with a gasket around the radar unit. Tesla now recommends removal of the gasket, as it can (1) become dislodged and interfere with radio waves; and (2) trap snow and ice in sub-freezing temperatures. This information comes from an internal Tesla service bulletin that is not publicly available, but has been confirmed by staff at both Watertown, MA and Dedham, MA service centers.[^1]

## Applies To

* Pre-facelift Model S vehicles with Autopilot hardware (approximately October '14 through April '16)

## Tools Needed

* Needle nose pliers

## Procedure

1. Kneel in front of your car, at the radar unit.
2. Using your needle nose pliers, latch onto one horizontal side of the gasket and pull straight out. The gasket will resist as it pulls away from double-sided tape. This is normal.

3. Repeat step 2 on the other side of the gasket.

When you're done, it'll look like this:
